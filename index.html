				</div>

				<div class="content-date">
					April 8, 2014
				</div>

				Thanks to everyone who came to General Meeting I today! Here's a list of all the other happenings going on this quarter:

				<br/><br/>

				<h4>UCLA Bruin Day: Saturday April 19 8am-2pm</h4>

				<p>Every year, SMACS volunteers at the Chemistry & Biochemistry Dept booth, helping with welcoming and recruiting new students and transfers to UCLA. It’s a great opportunity to tell incoming students what UCLA has to offer and what amazing experiences you have had thus far. If interested, please sign up for a shift by clicking here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OEUlT8WqwuHhpzVsF0QkbGd617VYmM7V6PpSjas8FGQ/viewform" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OEUlT8WqwuHhpzVsF0QkbGd617VYmM7V6PpSjas8FGQ/viewform</a></p>

				<br/>

				<h4>General Meeting 2: SMACS and Professionals</h4>

				<strong>Tuesday, April 22nd at 6:30PM in YH2033</strong>

				<p>SMACS is collaborating with Teach for America to bring you a panel of professionals (professors, doctors, pharmacists, professionals in industry) to come talk about their story and their thoughts on STEM Education. Come with your questions and an open mind as you are in the process of deciding what to do with your science degree!</p>

				<br/>

				<h4>SMACS at the 2014 Earth Day Fair</h4>

				<p>Want to learn more about the chemistry of your personal care products (e.g. cosmetics, shampoo, deodorant, etc) while also teaching others about less toxic alternatives and making an all-natural, vegan moisturizer? Get involved with the Earth Day Fair on Wed, April 23rd!! Volunteers are needed to represent SMACS at the fair between 10 am-2 pm (shifts based on your availability), as well as for set-up and clean up. We also need helpers to make the poster board and the homemade moisturizer. If you are interested in helping in any (or all!) of these areas, fill out the participation form here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12zy0xSidvShwIpXD5lsJvsbrgmlIIE2O5uLDyquVU5k/viewform" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12zy0xSidvShwIpXD5lsJvsbrgmlIIE2O5uLDyquVU5k/viewform</a></p>

				<br/>

				<h4>UCLA Cogeneration Plant Tour</h4>

				<p>This quarter, we will be attending a tour of UCLA's very own natural gas power plant. It's called a "Co-gen plant" because it combines heat and power production, making it twice as efficient as a normal power plant. The tour will be hosted by Ms. Nurit Katz, UCLA's chief sustainability officer. This is definitely an opportunity you don't want to miss!! More details and sign-ups to be announced at the upcoming meeting.</p>
