				<h5 id="q1">What is SMACS?</h5>
				<p>SMACS at UCLA is a student chapter of the American Chemical Society (ACS), the world’s largest scientific society. We are a newly-revived student group on campus that is open to undergrads and grad students of all majors.</p>

				<a href="#top" style="float: right;">Return to Top</a>

				<br/>

				<h5 id="q2">What do you do?</h5>
				<p>We plan events to fulfill the following objectives:</p>

    			<ol>
    				<li>to help become more informed about possible careers in chemistry in academia, industry, medicine, health, the government, and alternative paths.</li>
    				<li>to foster a sense of community among undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty (mostly in the sciences).</li>
    				<li>to excite youth about chemistry and make it relevant beyond the classroom.</li>
    			</ol>

    			<br/>

    			<h5 id="q3">When and where are meetings?</h5>
    			<p>There are typically three general meetings each quarter in 2033 Young Hall, Mondays at 6pm. We also have several events for outreach/ community service, conferences, and socials. Join our mailing list and look at our website to keep updated on specific times and locations!</p>

    			<br/>

    			<h5 id="q4">How is SMACS different from AXE?</h5>
    			<p>SMACS and AXE have similar goals; we just work toward them in different ways. We work together for the benefit of the Chemistry & Biochemistry department.</p>

    			<p>AXE is a close-knit community that plans frequent social events for its members, donates money to the department, holds outreach events, and awards a faculty member every year at their Seaborg Banquet. In contrast, SMACS events are planned by its officers and anyone else who wants to be involved. As such SMACS events are more open to general members and all of SMACS' resources are more readily available to members.</p>

    			<br/>

    			<h5 id="q5">How many members do you have?</h5>
    			<p>On average, about 25 members come to an event, but about 70 students came to four different events in Spring 2011.</p>

				</p>Our 2011 fall recruitment at the Enormous Activity Fair was very successful, and our membership is expected to increase. SMACS-UCLA is excited to have the opportunity to provide resources and guidance to more undergraduates in the upcoming year!</p>

				<h5 id="q6">What can I do if I want to get involved?</h5>
				<p>Contact us through <a href="mailto:acsbruins@chem.ucla.edu">email</a>, <a href="index.html">website</a>, or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/201617803193392/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. We can always find something you would like to do, whether it be event-planning, advertising, graphic design, outreach, making demo’s, networking, fundraising, working with premed and industry-oriented organizations, while making contacts with the faculty in the science departments around campus.</p>

				<h5 id="q7">How do I get a periodic table of the elements blanket?</h5>

				<p>You must be already be a member of national ACS and refer someone else to be a new or returning member. Please email us or see our Facebook page because we continuously find new people to nominate so that more people get blankets! Membership with national ACS costs $24. Benefits include a subscription to Chemical & Engineering News (CEN), an enormous network of chemists, and reduced rates to ACS conferences.</p>
